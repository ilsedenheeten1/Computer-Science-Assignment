# Computer-Science-Assignment

This project is about finding a method to find similar products on different Web shops. The structure of the code is as follows. First, the data is cleaned by removing all inconsistencies. Next, model words are extracted from the titles with a regular expression. Only the unique model words are used. Thereafter, a binary frame is made based on these model words. Minhashing is then applied to the binary vectors. The technique of min-hashing is used to compress the binary vectors, in this case to around 50% of its original size, without losing much information. Next, LSH is used to pre-select the potential duplicates. Furthermore, bootstrapping is performed for LSH. The values of r and b have to be changed. Run for every possible combination to perform the bootstrapping. This will give you the optimal r and b values. For the rest of the code, use these values. Next, if LSH did not label products as candidate duplicates, the distance between a pair is set to infinity. I aggregate the key's with the string "brand" in the value such that a brand that contains a subset of another brand will be considered as similar. If not, the distance is set to infinity. The cosine distance is computed for the remaining candidate duplicates. Thereafter, the dissimilarity matrix is made. Lastly, a classification algorithm is performed with bootstrapping by doing grid search for the tc value.
